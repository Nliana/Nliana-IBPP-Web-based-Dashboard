        'answer' => 'IBPP is a plug-and-play platform that can do benchmarking and pentesting on new IoT devices to ensure that it meets the conditions that are promised by the suppliers. 
        
        This is done by using multiple Raspberry Pi 4s that will integrate benchmarking and pentesting open-source software and will be connected to the IoT devices that will be tested. 
        
        The system will be integrated with tools such as iPerf3 and Nmap. The results of the tests from benchmarking and pentesting can be viewed in the web-based dashboard. 
        
        All in all, the project is done to ensure that users may use IoT devices to their fullest potential and are secured from malicious attacks.'

        Then, fill in the device name and type. Press Submit. 
        Then, choose at least one of the tests options that are shown on the screen. Press submit to conduct test.
        
        The results of the tests can be viewed in the dashboard page. The more detail results can be viewed in each of the respective test pages.
